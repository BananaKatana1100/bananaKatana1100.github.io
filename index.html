        <p>Today I started Pokemon FireRed on the gametime player. I started off by picking a starter, Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur would prove helpful against the first and second gyms with it's Grass-Poison typing. I made my way through the routes, not finding much, and leveling up Bulbasaur. But on Route 4, I found a Mankey, who's Fighting type and high attack would be a nice touch.
After fighting through Viridian Forest, I found myself in Pewter City, the home of the first gym leader, Brock. After a quick battle of Mankey and Bulbasaur punching and leeching off Brock's Onix, I got the first gym badge, and the TM (Technical Machine), Rock Tomb. A rock type move the lowers speed, which I instantly taught to Mankey.</p>

Returning to Pokemon FireRed, I ventured east, where I found a Nidoran Male, A poison type with very well rounded stats, and an eventual Ground type. With my three Pokemon, I battled my way into Mount Moon. Inside Mt Moon was uneventful, Except for finding a Moon stone and a Helix fossil. Outside of Mt Moon, I found two move tutors, one teaching Mega Punch, one teaching Mega Kick. I taught Mega Kick to Mankey and reached Cerulean City, and happily, I evolved my Bulbasaur into an Ivysaur, and my Nidoran into a Nidorino, and with that, I was ready to take on my rival, Tox.
